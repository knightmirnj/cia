### Context

While noticing the dataset shared publicly by the CIA, the reliability was boosted dramatically. The CIA, however, shares this data a little bit limited on raw data than what is actually being shared on the website itself. Throughout this dataset, every raw data shared by the CIA officially has been merged together in the same pattern for easier analysis and visualization. Every topic and column has been stored separately and also in a merged form.


### Content

The following are the columns and the content in each of them accordingly containing the data almost for 250 countries each. Some data in some columns can be missing for some respective countries.
